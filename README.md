# rangame
Brand new to Github, not sure if I'm doing ANY of this correctly.
Project Background: This is a general learning exercize of creating a random number guessing game with various features, starting with php and js.
Attempt A: Got the game framework started but the rand function is not working. I did a fair amount of troubleshooting. The html is seeing the php but that one part of generating the random number isn't working.
